### Run Model Help

Steps to run the model: 

1. Select the thinning.
2. Select the model mode.
3. Press the run button.
   - Model may take over 24 hours to run, be patient. 
   - The run is complete when the Outbox is populated with a table.
   - If there is an issue a pop-up box will appear indicating something is not valid, this must be fixed, and the run button will need to be pressed again to restart the model run.
   - The app has crashed and needs to be restarted if any of the following occur:
      - The screen goes grey and does not have a white spinner in the middle of the screen. 
      - A box appears in the bottom left corner saying disconnected.
      - An error message appears in the Console of RStudio.
4. Download the Analysis Object or Table and continue to the Results tab.

#### Parameters

##### Thinning

- Allowed values are an integer between 1 and 10000.
- Increase thinning if the model does not converge.
  - The model did not converge if the converged value in the output table is FALSE. 
- As the thinning value increases the run time will also increase. 
  - Start with a small thinning value and increase as needed. 
  - Thinning is often increased by various values try 1, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, etc.

##### Model Mode 

There are three model modes:

- quick
  - For testing the models runs.
  - Model results wonâ€™t be accurate, but this mode is helpful when first running the model to ensure everything is running correctly.
  - Run includes 2 chains and 10 iterations. 
- report 
  - This is a full run of the model. 
  - This mode will take much longer then quick mode. 
  - Run includes 3 chains and 500 iterations.
- debug
  - Verbose output for debugging.
  - Use this mode if errors are occurring and more help is needed.
  - Read the messages printed to the Console of RStudio to determine what is going on. 
  - Run includes 2 chains and 10 iterations. 

#### Description of Table

**n**

- Sample size.

**K**

- Number of parameter terms in the model.

**nchains**

- The number of chains.

**niters**

- Number of iterations. 
- A count of the number of simulations to save per chain.

**nthin**

- How much the chains should be thinned out before storing them.
  - Setting nthin = 1 corresponds to keeping all values.
  - A value of nthin = 100 would result in keeping every 100th value and discarding all other values.

**ess**

- Effective sample size (ess).
- The number of independent samples with the same estimation power as the n autocorrelated samples.
- Measure of how much independent information there is in autocorrelated chains.
- Doubling the thinning rate doubles the ess.

**rhat**

- A ratio of variances that compares the between- and within-chain estimates for model parameters.
- Evaluates whether the chains agreed on the same values.
- As the total variance of all the chains shrinks to the average variance within chains, r-hat approaches 1 (close to 1 is ideal).

**converged**

- Whether or not the model converged. 
  - Determines whether the model chains agreed on the same values.
- TRUE
  - This indicates the model converged.
  - A model must converge for the results to considered accurate. 
- FALSE
  - This indicates the model did not converge.
  - The model should be run again with different parameters or more data until the model converges.
  - Results may not be accurate if the model did not converge.

#### Download Options

After a successful run of the model two download buttons will appear in the top left of the Output box.

- Analysis Object
  - Download the output of the model run as a rds file.
  - This allows users to use the output of the model after the app closes.
- Table
  - Download the output table as a .csv file.  

#### Helpful Tips

- If you set the thinning to 1 and model mode to quick you can get a quick run of the model. This can help to make sure there are no issues with the data before doing a report run that may take a day or more to run.
